# Pacmen Factory

## Description
<p>Pacman game to make the pacman move around your screen.</p>

## Instruction
<p>Fork this respository to your own, and then drag the html file into your browser. Click on the Add Pacman button to get started. Add as many pacman as you would like. Then click on Start Game to watch them bounce around the screen. You can continue to add pacman after they have begun moving. </p>

## Improvements
<p>Updates that I would like to come back and do are having them open and close their mouths, have the pacman change color when they bounce, and have their faces reverse.</p>
